This master's thesis project served, mainly, two purposes. First, to
recapitulate, rationalise and re-focus a long-term project that has
served its author as learning sketchbook for many years. Second, to
give the first big steps in lifting the software to a professional
quality grade. Of course, there is a lot of work to be done, yet
crucial achievements have been made during the last year. In
the analysis chapter the project was planned for a long-term
development in an iterative process. This allows us to concentrate on
feasible mid-term goals while building a broadly scoped system. Two of
these iterations have been successfully accomplished.

Coming from a computer-science background, admittedly, we are still
quite amateur in many musical and even digital signal processing
aspects. Instead, we focused in what we can do better --- exploiting
programming languages abstraction facilities, making scalable
architectures and applying and eliciting design patterns in order to
write shorter, safer and faster code. The upcoming new C++ standard
provided us with a big open ground for research in new ways of using
multi-paradigm programming for our purpose. The most novel part of our
work is concentrated in our first iteration, where template
metaprogramming and concept-based design allowed us to write a sound
processing library that is generic yet efficient and safe. The last
stage also included relevant novelties --- like our polymorphic event
system for real-time processing --- yet being more pragmatical and
focused on requirement satisfaction and enabling concrete features,
like a hierarchical patches, a plug-in system, and so on. We should
not, though, look at these advancements indulgently. Their own
chapters further discusses their benefits, caveats, and open ground
for improvement.

Figure \ref{fig:dev-progress} shows the project growth in lines of
code, measured automatically from the sources repository by the Ohloh
webpage\footnote{Ohloh is a social network for Free Software
  development. Visit Psychosynth's page for further statistics:
  \url{https://www.ohloh.net/p/12930}}. Around 30000 new lines of code
have been added during the last year. However, most of our work have
involved fully rewriting legacy code --- in other statistics, Ohloh
states that around 100000 lines of code have been changed during all
the commits. This have been the biggest effort since the participation
of the project in the Free Software Contest. Including \emph{``logic
  code only''} Ohloh estimates that the total effort of the project
--- since its beginning in mid 2007 --- in 12 person-years. It used
the \emph{Basic COCOMO} \cite{bohem00cocomo} method with coefficients
$a = 2.4, b = 1.05$ to yield such result.

When looking into the future there are many possibilities. We are half
way to fulfil the long-term goals that were proposed in the first two
chapters. Apart from following our current plan blindfolded, there are
some developments that may make us re-plan part of our future work.

First, there is the \index{collaborative roadmap}\emph{Collaborative
  Roadmap}. As part of the redesign of the project's web-page that we
did in March (see figure \ref{fig:webpage}) we included a feature
request voting system based on micro-donations. The
\index{Flattr}Flattr\footnote{\url{http://flattr.com}} social
micro-payment network works as follows: each person puts some money
into her account each month. Then, different \emph{things} --- music,
software, pictures --- get a web button that users can press to show
support. At the end of the month, the money in someones' account is
distributed among all the creators of the things she clicked. Usually,
each individual click does not give much, but very popular things can
get a significant amount of money. Also, each Flattr button has a
counter with the number of people that pressed it. We use this system
in an special way: each potential feature not yet developed has its
own Flattr button. If someone thinks some feature is more urgent than
another, he can push for his opinion to be taken into account by
showing some commitment by making a micro-donation in this
system. Table \ref{tab:flattr} shows the current ranking in the
Collaborative Roadmap.

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{r|l}
    Votes & Thing \\ \hline
    11 & GNU Psychosynth --- general \\
    6 & Audio input \\
    4 & MIDI support \\
    1 & Plug-in system \\
    1 & Tangible user interface \\
    1 & VST plug-ins \\
    & ...
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Current ranking in the \emph{Collaborative Roadmap}, as in June 2010}
  \label{tab:flattr}
\end{table}

The Collaborative Roadmap credibility depends on whether we actually
take it into account. Thus, now that this master's thesis project is
over, we will devote some time to the most voted items. Indeed, the
``Audio Input'' feature seems quite feasible and fun to have,
so... why not?

Moreover, the growing interest in the project are opening the doors
for quite interesting collaborations. The ArtQuimia Music Production
School\footnote{\url{http://www.artquimia.net/}} has been supporting
the project since we started our requirement elicitation a year ago,
and we are grateful for this. More recently, Miguel Vazquez-Prada
contacted us to join efforts in building experimental tangible
instruments. He has already built a ReacTable clone called
Tangiblex\footnote{\url{http://www.tangiblex.net/}} with impressive
results (figure \ref{fig:tangiblex}). Hopefully this is the beginning
of a very fruitful collaboration. Indeed, a hardware-software pair is
probably one of the best ways to build a business model for a consumer
oriented application while respecting user's freedom with
non-privative licenses. Also, Intel is offering a wide range of grants
and other kinds of support and partnership programs to promote their
Meego platform and Atom-based devices. That might be a good chance to
prioritise a port for multi-touch devices --- a very interesting
development with open grounds for experimentation and innovation.

Anyway, whatever happens next, we have enjoyed and learnt a lot during
the development of this project. That is, indeed, all what one should
expect from a master's thesis project.

Thanks a lot for reading this document.
