@book{boulanger00csound,
  abstract =	 {{Created in 1985 by Barry Vercoe, Csound is one of
                  the most widely used software sound synthesis
                  systems. Because it is so powerful, mastering Csound
                  can take a good deal of time and effort. But this
                  long-awaited guide will dramatically straighten the
                  learning curve and enable musicians to take
                  advantage of this rich computer technology available
                  for creating music. Written by the world's leading
                  educators, programmers, sound designers, and
                  composers, this comprehensive guide covers both the
                  basics of Csound and the theoretical and musical
                  concepts necessary to use the program
                  effectively. The thirty-two tutorial chapters cover:
                  additive, subtractive, FM, AM, FOF, granular,
                  wavetable, waveguide, vector, LA, and other hybrid
                  methods; analysis and resynthesis using ADSYN, LP,
                  and the Phase Vocoder; sample processing;
                  mathematical and physical modeling; and digital
                  signal processing, including room simulation and 3D
                  modeling. The book comes with two CD-ROMs that
                  include more than forty additional HTML chapters;
                  hundreds of musical compositions; more than 3,000
                  working instruments; the Csound application for
                  Macintosh, PC, and Linux; and a number of Csound
                  audio and score-generating utilities. Book/CD-ROM

                  dimensional fiducial (marker) tracking system
                  developed for the reacTable*, a table based tangible
                  musical instrument. Key features of reacTIVision
                  include (1) the ability to track a large number of
                  fiducials with faster than real-time performance and
                  (2) fiducial size may be varied depending on the
                  number of distinct fiducial identities required. We
                  describe recent advances in our implementation of
                  topologybased fiducial recognition, including a
                  generalised method for accurately computing fiducial
                  location and orientation. A method of graph naming
                  known as left heavy depth sequences is applied to
                  the identification of topologically distinct
                  fiducials. Also discussed is our approach to
                  generating fiducial images for the system, in which
                  we employ evolutionary computation to produce
                  compact fiducials with specific geometric
                  properties.},

  abstract =	 {{We explore a variety of design criteria applicable
                  to the creation of collaborative interfaces for
                  musical experience. The main factor common to the
                  design of most collaborative interfaces for novices
                  is that musical control is highly restricted, which
                  makes it possible to easily learn and participate in
                  the collective experience. Balancing this trade off
                  is a key concern for designers, as this happens at
                  the expense of providing an upward path to
                  virtuosity with the interface. We attempt to
                  identify design considerations exemplified by a
                  sampling of recent collaborative devices primarily
                  oriented toward novice interplay. It is our
                  intention to provide a non-technical overview of
                  design issues inherent in configuring multiplayer
                  experiences, particularly for entry-level players.}},

  abstract =	 {This article reflects the current state of the <a
                  href=http
                  //www.iua.upf.es/mtg/publicacions.php?lng=eng&aul=3&search=reactable>reacTable*
                  project</a>, an electronic music instrument with a
                  tangible table-based interface, which is currently
                  under development at the Audiovisual Institute at
                  the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. In this paper we are
                  focussing on the issue of Dynamic Patching, which is
                  a particular and unique aspect of the sound
                  synthesis and control paradigms of the
                  reacTable*. Unlike common visual programming
                  languages for sound synthesis, which conceptually
                  separate the patch building process from the actual
                  musical performance, the reacTable* combines the
                  construction and playing of the instrument in a
                  unique way. The tangible interface allows direct
                  manipulation control over any of the used building
                  blocks, which physically represent the whole
                  synthesizer function.},
