The Psychosynth project aims to create an interactive modular
soft-synth inspired by the ideas of the Reactable. We will try to
provide a clean object oriented API to allow the creation of new
innovative interfaces for the synthetizer and a 3D simulator of a
Reactable-alike device with support for collaborative music creation
over the internet.

This package provides
---------------------

  * **libpsynth**: This is a powerful modern C++ library for the
    building of synthesis software. Type-safe audio buffer and I/O
    abstractions, inspired by
    [Boost.GIL](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/gil/doc/index.html),
    a generic system modular synthesis engine, classes for the
    synchronization of synths over the network using OSC, a framework
    for easy application creation, among other stug....

  * **psynth3d**: An interactive synth with an look similar to the
    Reactable's and a 3D interface which makes use of all the power of
    libpsynth.

  * **psynth**: A command line version of the synth that can be used
      as OSC server or client with low resource usage.


Depdencies
----------

To try the software you will need these third party libraries and programs:

   * GNU Autotools (only for the development version)
   * Ogre (needed by the 3D interface)
   * CEGUI (needed by the 3D interface)
   * OIS (needed by the 3D interface)
   * liblo (needed for the network support)
   * libxml2 (needed for XML config support)
   * Alsa (needed for ALSA sound output)
   * Jack (needed for Jack sound ouput)
   * libsndfile (needed for pcm file support)
   * libvorbis (needed for OGG vorbis file support)
   * SoundTouch (needed for sample stretching)
   * Boost

In Debian and Ubuntu you can install all those dependencies with the
following command. Anyways, I suggest installing `liblo` from the
original sources because the version in the repositories is outdated
and contains a bug:

> ```
> apt-get install automake libtool libogre-dev libceguiogre-dev libois-dev \
>                 libcegui-mk2-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev liblo0-dev \
>                 libsndfile-dev libxml2-dev libsoundtouch1-dev libvorbis-dev \
>                 libboost-serialization1.35-dev libboost1.35-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev
> ```

Installing
----------

If you downloaded the program from Git you will first need to generate the compilation scripts:

> ```
> autoreconf
> ```

Now you will need to run the configuration script to detect the the libraries and set up the compilation settings.

> ```
> ./configure
> ```

Check that everything has been detected correctly and then compile the program:

> ```
> make
> ```

At last we must run these commands with superuser privileges to install:

> ```
> make install
> ldconfig
> ```

We can now run the 3D simulator:

> ```
> psynth3d
> ```
